# J124 Final Project Data Analysis and Visualization of WIC Benefits (Concentration on Different Population Groups)
# By Fernanda Frausto-Bonilla
# Story Pitch and Summary

The cost of living and raising a family has progressively increased on a U.S. national basis over many decades. Many pregnant women, especially those who identify as low-income, have little to no money left over to provide their unborn child with a good diet and confront food insecurity. According to data from Statista Research Department [(https://www.statista.com/statistics/216426/average-costs-of-raising-a-child-from-birth-to-age-18-in-the-us--in-2010-by-category/)] , the average cost of feeding a child in the United States from birth to age 18 was $39,060 in 2013. This expense equals an average annual cost of $2,170 for each child when divided by 18 (the total amount of years it predicted spending money on feeding a child). To assist those facing food insecurity, the Federal and State government provide special funds through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (commonly known as "WIC") to assist low-income women and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk. These funds are used to provide supplementary food, infant formula, medical care, and nutritional counseling. The purpose of this data is to break down the participation rates of different categories in regards to WIC. By this I mean, I will analyze which groups which include postpartum women, pregnant women, etc. are utilizing WIC and determine data analysis related concerns such as which group utilizes the program most, etc. My data study, in my opinion, is relevant since it shows comparisons between groups for the period (2013–2016) and raises issues regarding which populations normally need greater support and what the federal government should target with more resources.

# Pre-Data Analysis Process
* Download the "Pregnant_Women_Participation" and "Postpartum_Women_Participation" csv(s) for the years (2013-2016). There is a total of 8 csv(s) that should be cleaned on OpenRefine, uploaded to Google Drive, and opened with Google Sheets. In Google Sheets, import each csv into two separate sheets ("Pregnant_Women_Participation" and "Postpartum_Women_Participation") and color code by year (e.g. green for 2013, purple for 2014, yellow for 2015, and blue for 2016). Data on annual participation per year is color coded as pink across all years. 
# Notes: 
*I only needed to remove duplicate column names with no data and rename columns containing dates to be more straightforward when cleaning up the csv files.
*My data is limited to the years (2013-2016) because that was the only data available that I could find that 
# Data Analysis Process
* Analysis 1: Which population group (e.g. postpartum women, pregnant women, etc.) participated more actively in WIC services between 2013 and 2016? Was any group exceptionally active? 
* Analysis 2: Among pregnant women, which three state agencies or Indian tribal groups participated the most?
* Analysis 3: Among postpartum women, which three state agencies or Indian tribal groups participated the most?
* Analysis 4: 
* Analysis 5:
* 
* 
* What percentage of pregnant and postpartum women participate on average in WIC across all state agencies or Indian Tribal Organizations?
