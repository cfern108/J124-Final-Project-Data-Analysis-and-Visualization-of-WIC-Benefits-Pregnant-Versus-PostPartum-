# J124 Final Project Data Analysis and Visualization of WIC Benefits (Concentration on Different Population Groups)
### By Fernanda Frausto-Bonilla
# Data Analysis 
* Download the "Pregnant_Women_Participation" and "Postpartum_Women_Participation" csv(s) for the years (2013-2016). 
* There is a total of 8 csv(s) that should be cleaned on OpenRefine, uploaded to Google Drive, and opened with Google Sheets. Note: I only needed to remove duplicate column names with no data and rename columns containing dates to be more straightforward when cleaning up the csv files in OpenRefine.
* In Google Sheets, import each csv into two separate sheets ("Pregnant_Women_Participation" and "Postpartum_Women_Participation") group together the data. 
* There should be a color-coded system for each year (e.g. green for 2013, purple for 2014, yellow for 2015, and blue for 2016). All years' data on annual participation are color-coded in pink.

* My data is limited to the years (2013-2016) because that was the only data available that I could find that 
# Data Analysis Process
* Analysis 1: Which population group (e.g. postpartum women, pregnant women, etc.) participated more actively in WIC services between 2013 and 2016? Was any group exceptionally active? 
* Analysis 2: Among pregnant women, which three state agencies or Indian tribal groups participated the most?
* Analysis 3: Among postpartum women, which three state agencies or Indian tribal groups participated the most?
* Analysis 4: What is the percent change across the years (2013-2016) in WIC participation across all groups and all state agencies or Indian Tribal Organizations?
* Analysis 5:
* 




# Story Pitch and Summary

On a U.S. national basis, the cost of living and raising children has progressively increased rapidly. According to data from Statista Research Department [(https://www.statista.com/statistics/216426/average-costs-of-raising-a-child-from-birth-to-age-18-in-the-us--in-2010-by-category/)] , the average cost of feeding a child in the U.S. from birth to age 18 was $39,060 in 2013. This expense equals an average annual cost of $2,170 for feeding a child when divided by 18 (the total number of years it predicted spending money on feeding a child). As a result, more and more mothers (including soon-to-be-mothers) struggle to give their kids a healthy, quality diet and are compelled to deal with food insecurity head-on. To assist mothers and children facing food insecurity, the Federal and State government provide special funds through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (commonly known as "WIC") to assist low-income women and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk. These funds are used to provide supplementary food, infant formula, medical care, and nutritional counseling. In my story pitch, I am seeking to break down WIC participation rates by categories and understand which population groups utilize services the most. These categories include the following: postpartum women, pregnant women, and ---------. 

The purpose of this story is to shed light on WIC participation and to answer questions such as "Which population groups (e.g. pregnant women, postpartum women, etc.)make up the largest percentage of WIC participants?" or "Which state agency or Indian tribal organization has the highest relative par ticipation rate?" I think that by looking at the statistics, we can build a framework for deciding which population groups should receive more services and for figuring out where and why they do.
### Note: A limitation to my story analysis is that it's data relies on the period (2013-2016) because it was the only available data for these population groups specifically. 

this data is to break down the participation rates of different categories in regards to WIC. By this I mean, I will analyze which groups which include postpartum women, pregnant women, etc. are utilizing WIC and determine data analysis related concerns such as which group utilizes the program most, etc. My data study, in my opinion, is relevant since it shows comparisons between groups for the period (2013â€“2016) and raises issues regarding which populations normally need greater support and what the federal government should target with more resources.
